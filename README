This is the Clotho project.  It is a library that is intended to make it easy
to create worker thread pool based Internet servers.

This project is named after the youngest of the Fates.  Clotho was responsible
for spinning the thread of human life.  Appropriate for a threaded server
library, eh? 

Along with the library file, these header files are part of the deliverable:
deltaqueueaction.hpp  internetserver.hpp   servermaster.hpp
insensitive.hpp       internetsession.hpp  sessiondriver.hpp
