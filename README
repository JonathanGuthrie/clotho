valgrind --leak-check=full --show-reachable=yes -v ./httpd 2> valgrind.out

How do I start a new session?  Well, a new session starts when an incoming
connection hits the correct port.  The IMAP server has an IMAP server that
runs the "Accept" call, which then uses the session driver corresponding to the
socket number to create a new session.

I should be able to create a session pool object, passing it a listening
socket which creates and destroys individual session drivers, which form
the interface between the thread pool and the protocol-specific code.
