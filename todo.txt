done)  Lose the external socket class.

done)  Get rid of the requirement that the InternetSession derivative classes know about locking the action queue

done)  Make the driver visible again

done)  ThreadPool.hpp should pull items off a single queue rather than push items
  onto the individual worker queues.  That will allow the most items to finish
  the most quickly

done)  Add a tutorial with an example server.  Maybe an echo server.

done)  Use epoll instead of select

done)  Rename the "Getter" methods to not include an explicit "get"

done)  Put the high water marks back in ThreadPool.hpp

done)  Eliminate the static array of sessions that worked for select, but isn't appropriate for epoll

10)  Push to GitHub

11)  Add doxygen header blocks.

12)  Deal with the case where the socket might block on transmit

13) Unit tests?
